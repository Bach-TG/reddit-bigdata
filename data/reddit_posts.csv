1qdtmj4,ukpolitics,"Food waste, supermarkets, and why the UK still relies on “goodwill” instead of law","Hi all!

I'm not sure this is the right place for this but it is politics related.

A few weeks ago I wrote to a UK government minister about supermarket food waste. Not a long manifesto, just a focused letter pointing out that, in the UK, there is no legal prohibition on supermarkets destroying edible food, and no statutory duty to prioritise redistribution.

I did receive a response, which acknowledged the issue and pointed to existing voluntary schemes and partnerships with charities. In other words: the government approach remains reliance on retailer goodwill, not legislation.

I understand that the UK has wide, deep, and genuinely serious systemic problems; housing, infrastructure, NHS, productivity, governance and food waste can look minor by comparison. But I still think this is worth looking at, precisely because it’s one of the clearest, lowest-cost policy wins available.

Right now:

Perfectly edible food is routinely discarded due to over-ordering, cosmetic standards, “best before” misunderstanding, or seasonal packaging.

Redistribution happens where retailers choose to engage, not because they are required to.

Charities often get inconsistent supply, despite rising food insecurity.

Environmental and waste-processing costs are pushed downstream to the public.

France tackled this years ago by banning large supermarkets from destroying edible food and requiring surplus to be redistributed, processed, or repurposed. It wasn’t revolutionary, just a targeted legal obligation that aligned incentives.

What disappoints me is that the UK appears unwilling even to trial something similar, instead treating food redistribution as a reputational CSR issue rather than a structural one. Goodwill helps, but it’s fragile, uneven, and unenforceable.

I’m not claiming this would “fix” food poverty or the cost-of-living crisis. But it would:

Reduce waste at source

Improve supply consistency for charities

Cut unnecessary environmental damage

Do so without major public spending

At this point, I’m honestly not sure where this conversation belongs politically, or what the next lever even is, which is partly why I’m posting here.

If anyone knows:

whether this has been debated seriously in Parliament,

whether any MPs or committees have pushed for a French-style model,

or where pressure on this issue actually goes to die,

I’d genuinely appreciate pointers.

1qdthxd,ukpolitics,MPs changing parties and by-elections,"
Reform UK has picked up additional MPs through people changing parties rather than through elections, including more high-profile cases over the last week.

Party switching appears to be allowed, but in practice most people vote based on party policies, not just the individual MP. When someone changes parties mid-term, voters don’t get a say in that decision.

Is the current system the right balance between MPs being independent and voters having a say, or should changing party trigger a by-election? Do other democracies handle this differently?",Advanced-Pilot-3698,1768505950,0

1qdqhti,ukpolitics,Qatari influence in our country and your thoughts about it?,"So, I am not taking a position on this yet cause I like to be sure I have all the facts and information before I take a position on anything. What I have managed to comfortably verify so far is, the Qatari royal family and prominent businessmen of their country own a LOT of high end property in London, and all over the country. They also donate heavily to many of our most prestigious universities, which (I can't prove this though this is an assumption) gives them some say over the curriculum. They of course also house many of the top ranking members of the various branches of the Muslim brotherhood. This affects us and warrants a mention because although the brotherhood itself isn't a proscribed organization, many of the groups under its umbrella are considered to be bonafide terrorist organisations. And I know a lot of Qatari money goes into the ever increasing number of mosques that have been popping up all over the country for the last 30+ years. The other thing, and I think the importance of this should not be underestimated is Al Jazeera. In terms of soft power, they aren't quite on the level of the BBC yet but they are well on their way. 

Are there other ways that they have influence over us other than what I've mentioned? And how do you feel about this. Do you trust their intentions. I'd like to underscore this point with I have many Muslim friends, I do not have an issue when it comes to the matter of people being allowed to practice their faith (whatever that may be). But wether it's Christian, Muslim, Bhuddist, communist, whatever abstraction, powerful foreign influence in your countries affairs is not a good thing by my estimation no? 

Thoughts? And thanks for taking the time. I don't want this to become a Muslim vs Christian thing, I want to genuinely explore foreign political influence in our affairs. They happen to be a Muslim country, but that's not the angle I'm wishing to discuss. Although I appreciate it's not a secular country so it's going to be impossible not to mention it at least a bit to punctuate your points ",hecticeclectic666,1768499511,9

AFAIK, in most cases MP candidates are affiliated with one of the parties and they enter elections using party platform and voters tend to vote for a party rather than for this particular person.

If a serving MP decides to change a party, they no longer fit the platform they were elected on. Shouldn't this automatically trigger a by-election? Voters made a decision based on party affiliation (among other things) and now they are stuck with an MP who will represent a different party that probably has different priorities etc.

Just want some opinions and explanation in case I misunderstood something. Please don't start arguments about particular parties or MPs. Thanks!",lucidbadger,1768498149,108

1. Statutory and committee oversight since 2023, including what information Congress can compel from DoD and the IC on UAP activity at or near nuclear sites. 


2. Current command-and-control safeguards and incident reporting for nuclear forces, and whether any formal protocol addresses anomalous interference. If public, point to relevant unclassified doctrine or hearings. 


3. How AARO’s 2024 findings interface with claims in the recent hearing and with historical cases like Malmstrom. What has been independently corroborated, and what remains unverified.

>Analysis and diagnosis of lobbying based in Brussels

>Brussels, the capital of the EU and the main seat of its institutions, hosts over 12,800 organizations that officially engage in lobbying, according to the EU’s own Transparency Register.4 These include professional federations, chambers of commerce, unions, individual entrepreneurs, banks, regions, religious organizations, and associations of all kinds. However, this number is far lower than the real figure. It is estimated that Brussels has nearly 30,000 lobbyists, almost as many as employees of the Commission (32,000).5 This makes Brussels, after Washington, the city with the highest concentration of people seeking to influence legislative processes and general political decision-making, in a unique framework of 27 states and around 500 million citizens. It could be said that parallel to the gradual increase in the political power of European institutions over the last two decades, corporate lobbying has come to “colonize” large areas of the European district of the EU capital. This has created a complex universe that, until recently, was beyond the understanding of many activists. This complexity lies, of course, in the fact that lobbying activity often spreads through a multi-level strategy in order to build stronger legitimacy (Ridao, 2017, 2018).

This directive is prompting national governing bodies to adjust their eligibility criteria, raising concerns that science-based fairness policies could give way to political and ideological mandates.

The ruling emphasized that states cannot exclude providers for reasons unrelated to their professional qualifications.

This decision could set a precedent for how much control states can exert over federally funded healthcare programs, especially in politically sensitive areas like reproductive health.

1maqmyf,NeutralPolitics,Is a European Unified Military Command a viable option to NATO?,"For decades the NATO had remained the bedrock of Western European security against the Soviets and now against the Russians.

But following the dismantling of the Soviet Union, a general environment of peace had engulfed the European capitals. 
This prompted the European decision makers to opt for the peace dividend which generally resulted in drastic cut down of military budget and diversion of the fund to other welfare projects.

https://www.europeanfiles.eu/industry/defending-europe-the-time-of-the-peace-dividend-is-finally-over

The NATO which was mostly resourced with US military personnel and infrastructure meanwhile continued to provide for European security. However the US under the Trump administration's transactional approach demanded that Europeans pay for their security. This has sparked significant concern. For Europe, traditionally aligned with NATO, the unpredictability of US policies erodes its strategic autonomy. Western European leaders are particularly dismayed by Trump's handling of the Ukraine-Russia conflict and his interactions with Putin.

https://www.axios.com/2025/05/20/trump-putin-call-european-leaders-zelensky

Why the Trump administration's policies, even earlier the  haphazard US withdrawal from Afghanistan under Biden also surprised and disappointed European military leaders within NATO. 

https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmfaff/169/report.html

Furthermore, Trump's views on Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which guarantees collective defence, have raised alarms. 
Article 5 considers an attack on one member as an attack on all, and Trump's reluctance (though as of now, he seems to have agreed to continue) to adhere to this principle has sparked debate.

1jztv11,NeutralPolitics,Would it be feasible for the U.S. to replace some tariffs with a revenue-sharing trade model where export-reliant countries remit a small percentage of tax revenue collected from U.S.-bound goods?,"  
The U.S. is currently using tariffs and trade restrictions as primary tools to influence trade relationships and protect domestic industries. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, tariffs are designed to protect local industries by making imports more expensive, thereby encouraging consumers to buy domestically produced goods. However, tariffs can also increase prices for consumers and reduce national income. A 2019 study published in the *Quarterly Journal of Economics* found that tariffs imposed by the U.S. in 2018 led to a $51 billion increase in costs for U.S. consumers and firms, and a net real income loss of $7.8 billion.² Similarly, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported in 2020 that tariffs implemented between 2018 and 2020 would reduce U.S. real GDP by 0.5% and increase average consumer prices by 0.5%, with an average household income loss of $1,277.

Would it be more effective or sustainable for the U.S. to negotiate trade access using a different mechanism — such as requiring partner countries to remit a small percentage of tax revenue collected from goods exported to the U.S.?

For example, if a country exports $20B of goods to the U.S. annually and agrees to remit 1.5% from those goods, the U.S. could collect $300M without directly impacting consumer prices. This structure would maintain price stability while reinforcing the idea that access to the U.S. consumer market is a privilege with associated obligations. The exporting country is still generating tax revenue from those goods — this model would simply give the U.S. a share of the pie. It's similar to the Apple App Store: developers gain access to a massive marketplace, but pay a percentage in return.

Has any government ever implemented a model like this? Would it be practical or beneficial as an alternative to tariffs?

1jqq7oh,NeutralPolitics,What is the lowest tariff that Trump has applied in yesterday’s announcement?,"I don’t want to discuss the pros/cons of the tariffs, or why they may or may not have been applied to specific countries - that subject has been done to death already. But there is one very specific thing I’m not clear on.

[Several news outlets](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jxrnl9xe2o.amp) in my country are reporting a “10% baseline tariff” that applies to all imports.

[Other news outlets](https://news.sky.com/story/amp/us-seems-content-to-cosy-up-to-russia-instead-of-coerce-it-with-tariffs-13341300) are reporting that Russia (and others) have been “spared” the tariffs.

These two seem at odds with each other. The first implies that Russia is subject to (at least) 10% tariffs. The second implies that Russia is subject to no tariffs at all.

1jq3q1v,NeutralPolitics,What are the goals and legality of US President Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs?,"**Background**

Today, the US President [announced tariffs](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/02/trump-tariffs-april-2-liberation-day) on 76 countries (49 plus the European Union), bringing the average effective US tariff rate to the [highest since 1872.](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/fiscal-economic-and-distributional-effects-20-broad-tariff)

This is a two-part question. 

**Goals?**

First, what are the goals of the tariffs? 

In the announcement, Trump said, ""We will supercharge our domestic industrial base, we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers."" 

I can see a certain kind of logic in the first point there. If imported goods become more expensive, it stands to reason that at least *some* production would move to domestic facilities. For example, 18 car companies already [have plants in the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_automobiles_manufactured_in_the_United_States) If their imported models are subject to higher tariffs, they could theoretically shift production of those to US sites. Is that feasible? I don't really understand how tariffs pry open foreign markets.

The announced tariffs also claim to pursue ""fairness"" and ""rebalancing"" in trade. What's the evidence that US trade is unfair and imbalanced now?

Are those the main goals of this policy shift and is there historical precedent for tariffs achieving them? 

**Legality?**

My second question is about the legality of this action. 

The US Constitution explicitly [grants the Congress,](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-i#article-section-8) not the President, the power to levy duties. 

In the [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and-persistent-annual-united-states-goods-trade-deficits/) announcing today's moves, Trump claims authority under the [International Emergency Economic Powers Act,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Emergency_Economic_Powers_Act) which authorizes the president to regulate international commerce after declaring a national emergency in response to any unusual and extraordinary threat to the country. What is the threat on which the president is declaring a national emergency?

The order also claims authorities under the ""section 604 of the [Trade Act of 1974,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Act_of_1974) as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code.""

https://globalnews.ca/news/11094267/canada-election-2025-begins/

After replacing Trudaeu, Mark Carney called for general elections to receive ""a strong mandate to stand up to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats and negotiate 'the best deal for Canadians.'”

Since 2020, the U.S. trade deficit with Canada has grown considerably, hitting $54 billion.

https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/us-trade-deficit-by-country

However, some experts blame US imports of oil from Canada as the chief reason this is the case.

https://globalnews.ca/news/10979652/us-canada-trade-deficit-explained-history-trump/

They also note that if we remove the oil from the equation, it is Canada who has a trade deficit.

Is removing oil from the equation appropriate? Is it possible to leverage these tariffs as a way to decrease the cost of oil and thereby lower prices as a result?

1qdw8lp,PoliticalDiscussion,Is Trump best understood as reacting to perceived U.S. decline by rejecting the post-war international order?,"I’ve been thinking about how to interpret Trump’s foreign and domestic political behavior, and I’m curious how others view this through a political science or historical lens.
One possible interpretation is that Trump sees the United States as a declining hegemonic power and believes that the existing international order - largely built by the U.S. around alliances, multilateralism, and formal equality between states - no longer serves American primacy. From this perspective, working within that system cannot halt decline, so the alternative becomes disrupting or dismantling it in order to reassert dominance.
If this interpretation holds, then undermining alliances, challenging multilateral institutions, and using coercive or norm-breaking rhetoric are not random or impulsive acts, but part of a broader strategy that rejects liberal internationalism in favor of unilateral power.
Domestically, this raises a further question: if such a strategy conflicts with democratic norms and faces internal resistance, does political science suggest that leaders pursuing it are more likely to weaken democratic institutions or suppress dissent to maintain coherence between foreign and domestic policy?
I’m interested in whether this framework aligns with established theories of hegemonic decline, authoritarian drift, or historical examples of powers responding to perceived loss of status.

1qdah3d,PoliticalDiscussion,Do local elections have a greater impact on everyday life than protests or federal politics?,"I’m interested in discussing whether political energy is often misallocated toward national politics and protests, at the expense of local and state-level engagement.

Many of the policies that directly affect daily life are decided locally. Zoning and housing rules, school funding, policing practices, public transportation, public health measures, and local tax structures are largely shaped by city councils, mayors, school boards, governors, and state legislatures.

Despite this, voter turnout in municipal and local elections is consistently low, while attention and activism tend to concentrate on federal politics and national figures. This creates a situation where highly motivated minorities can have outsized influence over local policy simply because few people participate.

I’m not arguing that protests or federal elections are irrelevant. Rather, I’m questioning whether focusing more attention on local elections and local political organizing would be a more effective way to produce durable policy outcomes.

1qbk8fm,PoliticalDiscussion,What institutional mechanisms currently constrain a sitting president’s influence over federal and state elections in a midterm year?,"I’m trying to understand, in concrete terms, what institutional and legal mechanisms limit a sitting president’s ability to influence federal and state elections, particularly in a midterm year like 2026. This isn’t meant as a prediction, but as an examination of how executive authority interacts with enforcement, courts, state election systems, and legislative oversight.

This year presents some unique realities that shape these constraints:

* The president’s party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House (**trifecta**).
* The Supreme Court is ideologically aligned or generally deferential to executive authority.
* Congress has historically struggled to pass even routine legislation, limiting its ability to act quickly.

Given this context, I’m particularly interested in mechanisms that function *before* elections are certified or investigated afterward. Some questions I’d like to explore:

1. **Federal agencies:** How much can a president direct agencies like the DOJ or DHS in ways that could influence election administration, and which legal or procedural limits are meaningful when Congress is unlikely to act quickly?
2. **State-level election oversight:** How effective are secretaries of state, election boards, and state courts at constraining executive influence, especially if the federal executive has strong partisan alignment?
3. **Norms versus enforceable rules:** Which constraints rely on institutional norms rather than legally binding restrictions, and how resilient are those norms in a year with trifecta control and an aligned Supreme Court?
4. **Accountability mechanisms:** How effective are congressional oversight, inspections, and judicial review at limiting presidential influence in real time when Congress is gridlocked and courts may defer to the executive?
5. **Historical precedent:** Are there examples where these mechanisms actually functioned effectively against a sitting president in midterm elections, particularly under conditions of strong partisan control and limited legislative action?

I’m looking for answers grounded in law, political science, or historical examples, rather than predictions or speculation.",disembodied,1768286228,9
1qb8hs9,PoliticalDiscussion,What is next for voters who did not participate in the 2024 elections?,"Participation in the 2024 election was lower than in 2020 across the board by **19 million** voters. No major partisan coalition increased turnout relative to its 2020 baseline, and every group experienced some degree of voter drop-off. Taken together, this indicates a broad retreat from participation rather than a shift in partisan alignment, and is consistent with dissatisfaction or disengagement in response to the options presented.

For the *Democrats*, the effect was most pronounced, with roughly a **15%** drop-off from their 2020 voters, amounting to on the order of **10–12 million fewer** voters who participated at all in 2024.

When looking at the *Republicans*, the drop-off was smaller, closer to **10–11%** of their 2020 voters, corresponding to roughly **7–8 million fewer** voters compared to Trump’s 2020 coalition.

While per-party nonvoter polling is limited, and most nonvoter research focuses on the roughly one-third of independents who historically participate at lower rates, existing studies still point to a general set of reasons why some people who voted in 2020 did not vote in 2024:

* [Lack of enthusiasm for the candidates or choices available.](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/12/04/voters-and-nonvoters-experiences-with-the-2024-election/)
Pew Research found that a substantial share of nonvoters said they did not like the candidates or felt unmotivated to participate in the election.

* [Belief that voting would not meaningfully change outcomes.](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/12/04/voters-and-nonvoters-experiences-with-the-2024-election/)
Pew also reports that many nonvoters cited believing their vote would not make a difference or feeling disengaged from politics as a primary reason for abstaining.

* [Economic dissatisfaction, especially around cost of living.](https://prospect.org/2025/07/21/2025-07-21-bringing-back-nonvoters/)
Post-election polling of people who voted for Biden in 2020 but did not vote in 2024 found that concerns about inflation, housing costs, and economic insecurity were common reasons for disengagement.

* [Leadership or confidence concerns about the Democratic ticket.](https://prospect.org/2025/07/21/2025-07-21-bringing-back-nonvoters/)
The same post-election surveys cited by The American Prospect show that some 2020 Democratic voters who sat out 2024 pointed to doubts about leadership effectiveness or confidence in the campaign as factors in their decision.

*  [General disengagement and political fatigue rather than organized protest voting.](https://prri.org/spotlight/breaking-down-the-differences-between-voters-and-non-voters-in-the-2024-election/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
Across multiple surveys, nonvoters more often described their decision as disengagement, frustration, or lack of connection to the political system, rather than a deliberate protest strategy.

While it’s still early to draw firm conclusions about long-term trends, the 2025 off-year and special elections showed several instances where Democratic candidates outperformed their 2024 presidential margins in specific contests, and where Democratic control was maintained or expanded in state and local government. For example, Democrats flipped a Pennsylvania state senate seat that Trump carried in 2024, and they held or expanded state trifectas in Virginia and New Jersey. However, these contests had much lower turnout than presidential races and are not directly comparable to national participation levels, so any interpretation about broader re-engagement should be cautious and contextual.

That leaves an open question heading into the 2026 midterms and the 2028 general election: what role will the voters who chose not to participate in 2024 ultimately play? Are these voters temporarily disengaged and therefore likely to return under different conditions, or does the 2024 drop-off point to more persistent disengagement? To what extent can the factors cited in 2024 realistically be addressed through policy outcomes, candidate selection, or campaign strategy, and at what point should continued non-participation be treated as a durable constraint rather than a short-term anomaly?

So far, it is unclear what the outcome of this latest wave will be.

If these protests successfully lead to Ayatollah Khomeini being removed from power, what comes next? There have been a few widely discussed scenarios:

1. Iran returns to a shahdom, like they had before the Iranian Revolution. This would most likely be a constitutional monarchy. [Reza Pahlavi](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/10/nx-s1-5673238/reza-pahlavi-iran-protests) has been discussed as a possible leader by international experts. He is the son of the former Shah, and has lived most of his life in exile in the United States.
2. Khomeini is replaced with a new supreme leader, and the structure of government remains largely unchanged. This would require the Assembly of Experts to cave to public pressure and use their constitutional authority to remove him, or for Khomeini to willingly abdicate (possibly for fear of his own life) and allow them to appoint someone else.
3. Iran adopts a secular, democratic government. The protests heavily feature progressive politics, so is it possible that **both** the shahdom and revolutionary government will be seen as outdated? There has also been speculation that the United States may get involved, like it did in Venezuela, which could affect the direction the country takes.
4. The army revolts and forms a military dictatorship, most likely because their wages dry up. It is worth noting that many soldiers in Iran make [less than the official minimum wage](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202311074695), and that was before the current economic crisis.

• Some civilians may view the new government as serving U.S. interests rather than Venezuelan ones. This perception could motivate participation in armed resistance groups, potentially with indirect support from states opposed to U.S. influence, such as Russia or Iran.

• While support for Maduro himself may have declined, Chavismo remains a political identity. Hardline supporters particularly elements within the security forces could frame armed resistance in nationalist terms, even if they no longer support Maduro personally.

• Venezuela already has powerful criminal organizations and armed colectivos. A weakened or fragmented transitional state could allow these groups to expand territorially or politically, worsening instability.

Roe vs. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court in June of 2022, ending the federal constitutional right for a woman to choose to have an abortion and returning regulatory authority to the states. ([1](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn)) It only took a few months for abortion to become illegal or heavily restricted in about half of the states. ([2](https://www.colorado.edu/today/2024/06/20/2-years-after-roe-v-wade-reversal-impacts-and-whats-come)) 13 states had “Trigger Laws” in place to be enacted within 30 days of Roe being overturned while others enacted laws very shortly afterwards. Within a year 14 states had near total ban abortion laws in place. ([3](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-year-after-the-supreme-court-overturned-roe-v-wade-trends-in-state-abortion-laws-have-emerged/)) 

The main reason for my concern is Project 2025. While Donald Trump or the Republican party has never endorsed Project 2025, several members of his administration have. Donald Trump ([4](https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations)), J.D. Vance ([5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/01/jd-vances-ties-to-project-2025-explained-ahead-of-tonights-vp-debate/)) and several Republican members of the current Congress ([6](https://www.democracydocket.com/analysis/these-republicans-have-ties-to-the-group-behind-project-2025/)) have supported the Heritage Foundation, the authors of Project 2025. 

Trump has repeatedly denied that his administration is following the Project 2025 playbook, he has even denied having any knowledge of it. Despite this, many of the ideas put forward in the 900+ page document have been reflected in his policies and executive orders. ([7](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2025/trump-executive-orders-project-2025/)) These include issues regarding immigration and the boarder, reducing federal funding to sanctuary cities, LGBQT+ rights, ending diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI) policies, energy policies, reducing the size of government, and women’s health issues especially women’s access to abortions. ([8](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-enforces-overwhelmingly-popular-demand-to-stop-taxpayer-funding-of-abortion/)) 

Project 2025 proposes restrictions on women’s rights, especially in areas of reproductive health. ([9](https://nwlc.org/resource/project-2025-what-it-means-for-women-families-and-gender-justice/)) They justify these restrictions with the premise of protecting family and life. The plan calls for renaming the Department of Health and Human Services as the Department of Life and creating a federal funded anti-abortion task force. 

Proposals target family policies by penalizing single motherhood, subsidizing traditional marriage, and dismantling ACA protections that benefit women disproportionately. ([10](http://globalequality.org/storage/documents/cge-project2025-digital.pdf)) It would undermine workplace equity by limiting EEOC authority on sex discrimination and overtime pay, affecting women workers. Some states have introduced, but not passed, laws that would limit a woman’s access to divorce as well. ([11](https://institutedfa.com/no-fault-divorce-future/)) 

I actually have two questions I am hoping to generate some honest discussion about: 

1. Are there any other issues not addressed above that you see as a threat to women’s rights, either on the state or federal level? 
2. What do you think the coming year will bring regarding women’s rights?

1pzuxg4,PoliticalDiscussion,Should Congress have the ability to approve dismissals of executive branch officials by the President?,"Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the US Constitution grants the President the authority to make appointments that must be reviewed by the Senate. However, it makes no comment regarding how dismissals of executive branch officials should be handled.

In *Myers v. United States* (1926), the Supreme Court concluded that the power to dismiss executive branch officials is inherent in the President's authority to appoint officers and struck down a law requiring Senate approval of dismissals. In *Humphrey's Executor v. United States* (1935), the Court granted Congress the ability to restrict removals of some executive branch officials for ""cause""; however, in *Seila Law v. CFPB* (2020) and *Collins v. Yellen* (2021), the Supreme Court again imposed limits on Congress's ability to weigh in on dismissals by the President.

Some have argued that past Presidents have at times abused their unrestricted ability to dismiss executive branch officials. For example, some have alleged past Presidents have wrongfully dismissed the U.S. Attorney General. Significant concerns have also been raised regarding the dismissal of commissioners on the Federal Elections Commission and by mass firings of Inspectors General.

Many see the unrestricted power to dismiss executive branch officials by the President as granting the President the ability to coerce executive branch officials to ignore their oaths to uphold the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress. And many see such potential for coercion of executive branch officials as posing a significant threat to the future welfare and security of the Nation.

Give the past decisions of the Supreme Court, an amendment to the Constitution would be necessary to change the status quo in a meaningful and permanent way. Such amendment could require that dismissals by the President of certain executive branch officials (as determined by Congress) be approved by one or both branches of Congress. Such approval would help ensure that a President will not abuse their authority to dismiss government officials.

That gap raises an interesting political question. If people say they no longer trust political systems, why do those systems usually keep functioning anyway?



Possible explanations might include habit, lack of realistic alternatives, fear of instability, economic dependence, or a distinction between trust in individual politicians versus trust in institutions themselves.



In the UK this tension has become more visible in recent years, but similar patterns appear in other democratic systems as well.



Questions for discussion:

• Does declining trust actually threaten democratic stability?

• At what point does low legitimacy turn into real political change?

• Are modern democracies becoming more procedural than participatory?

• When people comply with systems they distrust, is that consent or simply necessity?

1pyao57,PoliticalDiscussion,Why is Barack Obama widely regarded as a respected elder statesman within the Democratic Party despite a record of policies and actions that conflict with many positions now central to modern Democratic and progressive ideology?,"I want to be clear from the start that this question comes from genuine academic interest and is tied to a political psychology project, not an attempt to attack or defend Obama or to compare political figures. The core of what I’m trying to understand has less to do with the individual policies themselves and more to do with the psychological and social mechanisms that allow a political base to remain loyal to and even revere a leader whose past record appears, at least on paper, to conflict with the group’s stated values as those values evolve over time.

During his campaign and early political rise, Obama publicly held positions that many modern Democrats would strongly reject today. In 2008, he opposed same sex marriage and stated that he believed marriage was between a man and a woman, supporting civil unions instead, a position now widely criticized on the left as separate but equal discrimination. He frequently framed policy positions through his Christian faith and supported faith based initiatives that involved government funding of religious organizations, which many secular progressives now view as a violation of church and state separation. His rhetoric around traditional family values, fatherhood, and personal responsibility was widely accepted at the time but is now often criticized by younger progressives as respectability politics or implicit victim blaming.

While some of these positions can reasonably be explained as products of their time, they are still relevant to how his modern status within the party is understood.

Once in office, his administration pursued or oversaw a series of actions that modern Democrats often describe as executive overreach or violations of civil liberties. In 2014, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in NLRB v. Noel Canning that Obama had violated the Constitution by making recess appointments when the Senate was not actually in recess. During the 2009 Chrysler bankruptcy, the administration pressured secured creditors while favoring labor unions, a move critics argued violated due process and property rights. After repeatedly stating that he lacked the authority to change immigration law unilaterally, Obama implemented DACA and attempted DAPA through executive action, prompting accusations of legislating from the Oval Office and resulting in the Supreme Court effectively blocking DAPA.

His Clean Power Plan used the EPA to impose sweeping environmental regulations that Congress had declined to pass, leading the Supreme Court to take the rare step of halting the program before lower courts ruled. Under his administration, police militarization expanded through the 1033 program. The Espionage Act was used more aggressively than under any prior administration to prosecute whistleblowers, including Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden. The Insider Threat Program encouraged federal employees to monitor coworkers for behavioral indicators of leaking, which critics compared to authoritarian surveillance cultures.

His administration also defended expansive executive authority, including the claim that the president could order the killing of U.S. citizens abroad without trial if deemed a threat. The drone program expanded dramatically, resulting in civilian casualties in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. The 2011 drone strike that killed U.S. citizen Anwar al Awlaki without trial was widely condemned by civil liberties organizations. NSA mass surveillance programs exposed by Snowden revealed bulk collection of Americans’ communications. The Libya intervention proceeded without congressional authorization beyond initial actions, raising War Powers concerns. The IRS controversy involving heightened scrutiny of conservative groups further fueled accusations of political abuse of power.

On immigration enforcement, Obama’s administration relied heavily on expedited removal, deporting large numbers of people without judicial hearings. The use of the 100 mile border zone rule expanded enforcement powers deep into the interior. Reinstatement of removal allowed prior deportation orders to be reactivated without new trials. Access to legal counsel was limited, and civil rights groups frequently sued the administration. Despite DACA, day to day enforcement was described by many advocates as a dragnet. High profile raids in early 2016 targeting Central American families drew condemnation from figures like Bernie Sanders. Programs such as Secure Communities forced local police to cooperate with ICE, leading to accusations of racial profiling. Worksite audits resulted in mass firings and deportations. Family detention centers expanded following the 2014 migrant surge, with human rights groups documenting harsh conditions for children and parents.

These are all actions and policies that modern Democrats, particularly younger and more progressive voters, strongly criticize when associated with contemporary figures. Many of them would be considered cancel worthy offenses in today’s political and cultural climate.

This is where my central question comes into focus. Between roughly 2014 and 2019, cancel culture rose sharply, particularly within left leaning spaces. Public figures were widely condemned, ostracized, or professionally destroyed for past statements or actions that conflicted with evolving norms. Yet virtually none of this applied to Obama. His influence, popularity, and cultural status only increased. He has not been pressured into apologies for these actions, nor do many younger Democrats appear aware that they occurred at all.

By modern standards for moral and ideological consistency within the left, Obama would seemingly fail many of the tests now applied to public figures. And yet, he remains arguably the most influential and respected individual associated with the Democratic Party.

Why? How did his public image survive an era that was unforgiving to others for similar or even lesser offenses? From a student perspective, this question helps frame a broader set of issues I’m trying to examine. I’m not asking these to be answered directly here, but to clarify the underlying purpose of the discussion. What psychological, social, and cultural dynamics allow this level of loyalty and insulation to persist? What does this reveal about identity formation, narrative framing, and selective accountability within political groups in the United States? And more broadly, what does it suggest about how individuals understand and reconcile a public figure’s historical record with their current reputation and standing?


TL;DR 
I’m genuinely trying to understand why Barack Obama remains one of the most respected and influential figures in the Democratic Party despite a record of policies and actions that conflict with many values now central to modern Democratic and progressive ideology. This isn’t about attacking or defending him, but about examining the psychological and social dynamics that allow political loyalty and reverence to persist as party beliefs evolve. Given that many public figures have been harshly criticized or “canceled” for similar or lesser issues in recent years, I’m interested in what this contrast reveals about identity, narrative framing, selective accountability, and how people reconcile a leader’s historical record with their current reputation.",LordSoftCream,1766977086,89
1py9gta,PoliticalDiscussion,Geopolitics (Projections): What happens after today’s long-standing heads of state are gone while fixation is on the current state?,"A lot of attention (understandably) is focused on U.S. internal politics, but it feels like we talk far less about the global leaders we’ve grown accustomed to—India, Russia, China, North Korea, etc.—and what happens when those familiar figures pass on or are suddenly removed from the picture.
Many of these leaders have been in power long enough that their personal image has become intertwined with their state’s identity. That creates a sense of complacency, as if the external world will remain mostly “the same,” just older, while we argue internally.
My question is less about who replaces them and more about direction:
How much continuity vs. rupture should we realistically expect in each case?
Are these systems stable enough to absorb leadership loss, or are they more fragile than they appear?
During transitions, is the greater risk internal instability, external aggression, or elite power struggles behind the scenes?
How do cult-of-personality systems evolve once the central figure is gone—do they dissolve, harden, or mutate?
It seems like multiple major leadership transitions could happen within the same decade. Are we underestimating how disruptive that overlap could be globally?

1py506o,PoliticalDiscussion,"Are States in Resistance, Insurrection or Rebellion to the Federal Government?","Starting in 2017 we had the Resistance to T45. That movement featured efforts by the bench, many bureaucrats and some politicians to stymie the Republicans through delaying or slow walking their Administration. Everyone saw that as typical political action and no one imagined it to be illegal. 

In 2021 we saw an attack on the Capitol. That of course was a bunch of citizens who tried to stop certification of the election of the Democratic ticket. Some of the opponents committed criminal acts, and Trump was impeached for his role of inciting the crowd. Most people at the time saw the incident as illegitimate and the event was labeled an Insurrection. 

Now in 2025 a group of states led by their political leadership are opposing the Administration’s immigration policies as well as other federal actions. They have passed state laws, have refused cooperation, and have extended help to people to evade positions taken by this Administration. Of course anyone can advocate for any position, but all States are constitutionally subservient to the federal system.

1pxuu0y,PoliticalDiscussion,Should the Ability of the President to Issue Pardons be Limited?,"Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the US Constitution gives the President the ability to grant pardons and reprieves for federal offenses. The Constitution places no limit on that ability.

Many have raised concerns about the President's ability to grant pardons. In theory, for example, it could potentially be used to encourage criminal conduct by members of the executive branch. More generally, it could be exploited for emoluments and quid pro quo favors.

Because it is a power granted by the Constitution, it would require a Constitutional amendment to place a limit on this power of the President. One such amendment could grant Congress the ability to veto a Presidential pardon by a supermajority vote in favor of such veto in either one or both chambers.

Should the power of the President to grant pardons and reprieves be limited in any way? If so, how? If not, why?",NewConstitutionDude,1766937779,280
